# ICU QI
A mobile PowerApp for collecting data from ICU staff (or any ward) about each patient to ensure quality of service. Includes prompts to update data where there is key missing information. 

There are two supporting Power Automate flows to check the Dataverse for Teams tables for old patients and missing data.
